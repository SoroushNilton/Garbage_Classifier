To run the garbage classification model, please follow these steps:

1) Extract the contents of the garbage_classification.zip file.

2) Navigate to the extracted folder and run the training script on the Atlas platform using the Halo environment. The steps are explained in detail in the report.

3) After training, the model will be saved in the .air file format.

4) Copy the .air file to the HIAI_PROJECTS/mobilenetv2_garbage in the model directory on the Atlas DK200 server. The steps are explained in the report.
